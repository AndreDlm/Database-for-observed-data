# Database for observed data
This database ([ObsDataPK_OSP.xlsx](../../raw/master/ObsDataPK_OSP.xlsx)) stores pharmacokinetic data from publicly available sources (e.g. peer-reviewed articles etc.).
The database is described in the *data item specification list*: [obsDataPK_OSP_DISL.docx](../../raw/master/obsDataPK_OSP_DISL.docx). 

Respective PK data have carefully been transferred and digitized from the referenced original sources.

The sub-database [DDI.csv](../../raw/master/DDI.csv) represents the sheet `DDI` of [ObsDataPK_OSP.xlsx](../../raw/master/ObsDataPK_OSP.xlsx) and may serve as input to qualification plans in the context of drug-drug interactions (DDI).
